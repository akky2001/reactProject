# reactProject

Excited to share my first React project - the Task Tracker! ğŸš€
It's like a cool to-do list where I learned to use hooks such as useState and useEffect. With simple features like adding, deleting, and updating tasks, it's a great way to dip your toes into React. Check it out and start organizing your tasks easily! ğŸ’¼ğŸ’»
I've even deployed it on Netlify for easy access. Check it out here: [ https://task-tracker-111.netlify.app/ ] and start organizing tasks effortlessly!
